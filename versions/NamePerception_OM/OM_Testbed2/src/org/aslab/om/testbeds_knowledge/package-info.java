/**
 * This package provides classes to create knowledge atoms about components in the testbeds,
 * according to our metamodel. For example, LaserModel provides a constructor that creates an instance of
 * ComponentClass that corresponds to the type of laser simulated by OM_Testbed2/nodes/fake_laser.py
 * All these classes could, and probably should, be replaced by either:
 * - XML files and a parser
 * - model files and an automated transformation from UML (stereotyped) to our metamodel
